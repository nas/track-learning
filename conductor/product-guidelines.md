# Product Guidelines - Learning Tracker

## Visual Identity
- **Theme:** Warm, friendly, and inviting. The design should feel personal and encouraging, like a helpful learning companion.
- **Color Palette:** Utilize a palette of softer, natural tones (e.g., muted greens, earthy browns, warm grays) to create a calming and approachable aesthetic. Avoid harsh contrasts.
- **Typography:** Employ readable, slightly rounded sans-serif fonts for body text and headings to enhance the friendly feel.
- **Imagery/Icons:** Use friendly, perhaps slightly illustrative icons. Avoid overly corporate or stark visuals.

## User Interface (UI)
- **Component Style:** Components should have soft edges and subtle shadows, reinforcing the warm, organic feel. Avoid sharp corners.
- **Interactions:** UI feedback should be gentle and clear. Transitions should be smooth and not jarring. For example, modal openings could have a soft fade-in effect.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, maintaining the friendly feel across devices.

## Prose & Tone
- **Tone:** Consistently friendly, conversational, and encouraging. Imagine speaking to a helpful study buddy.
- **Messaging:** Use inclusive language ("Let's track your progress!", "What did you learn today?"). Keep instructions simple and supportive.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear, positive, and helpful messages for all user interactions. Error messages should be constructive rather than alarming.
